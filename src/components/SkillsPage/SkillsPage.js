            I started programming 5 years ago. At first I was developing native mobile applications
            and games for Android and iOS platforms. Then I started shifting towards web
            development. During first years of my web developer career I was working on several
            projects as a Fullstack developer. right now I’m focusing solely on Frontend development
            with React, however I believe that my backend experience is a big advantage when
            cooperating with other backend developers on a project. Now I’m also developing hybrid
            mobile applications for both Android and iOS using Flutter.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my career I developed several mobile applications and websites for clients as a
            freelancer, but I am also constantly improving my skills by creating my own projects.
            For a year and 8 months I was working as a software developer at Vendim company where I
            was responsible for developing UI’s and REST API’s for modern vending machines.{" "}
